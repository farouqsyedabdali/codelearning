This project is a "guess the word" beginner game made in python.

I have specifically used OOP for this project. Although it is not needed, I need to practice my python skills as I am a beginner at this

It is a very simple 2 player game with no GUI and based completely off of the terminal. Player 1 enters a word and Player 2 has to guess that number. However, the number of chances that Player 2 has is equal to the number of letters in the word. At the end, Player 2 has to guess the word using only the letters he got correct. It is very difficult

Messy code and unneccisary variables are prominent here. Please excuse them.
