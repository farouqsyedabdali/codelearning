This is a very basic program that allows you to add a course into the program. You can add as many as you want. You will then add students to a course, after entering their information. If the student qualifies for the course, they are registered. Otherwise, they will be prompted to choose another course.

I am a high school student and I'm trying to learn Python. Please excuse any messy code or excessive lines. I don't know much and I'm just starting out with OOP as well. If you have any questions or tips for me, feel free to contact me at farouqsyedabdali@gmail.com or connect with me at my Linkedin here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/farouq-syed-abdali/.
